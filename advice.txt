Website
Consider remove integrity and crossorigin from script tags,[done]
Consider move style.css to load last,[done]
Consider use one entrypoint for all your CSS etc like cdnjs (this can apply to bootstrap and font awesome popperJs, jquery)
Consider not use Font Awesome JS use CSS instead. If you are using Brand icons only then use font-awesome brands from CDNJS
Consider a different footer color it looks to cut off the bottom.

### HTML

Consider move font imports into CSS (The font you are importing is not even used so no need for it in HTML)
Consider not use absolute paths / ./ when loading things use relative paths.
Consider add target="_blank" and rel="noopener" to links that are going to other domains.
Replace ./link with link use relative paths not absolute paths gives less problems down the line. (example ./about.html should be about.html`
As most content is the same I would suggest make a one page scrollable website, and divide the sections more then have seprate pages.
Home and Best Sellers are identical almost.
Consider add a section for contact etc.
Your HTML is invalid and produces a lot of errors.
there is no need to have a hero section with a empty hero image,  use the section - Technically you are creating a div with an empty div inside. This is bad practice.
Consider move all classes from sub-div that are direct childs of section a section is a DIV and can use id and classes no need for a div under it to do what it already can do. Avoid nesting to much.

### CSS

Consider remove unused font imports
Consider use a certain font size and import this correctly
If body is assigned there is no need to repeat yourself (You want to be DRY in CSS) - if unsure ask in #user-centric
When repeating yourself consider make a common CLASS and have the common part in this
You are targeting img inside a logo but no image is present no need for this then.
It's considered bad practice to use % for font-size, use rem
Again do not use absolute paths in CSS or HTML you want to use relative paths for images etc hero-image
Your CSS is invalid and produces errors.


Readme
No Readme provided this will make it automatic fail.
Consider move favicons into assets as they are part of assets when the website loads
Consider make a better folder structure of assets, CSS folder should hold css files.
Consider add sections that match user stories
There are no wireframes.
Consider to give your REPO a better name before submitting (this can be renamed in github) (What if people want to hire you, then the name matters)
