This is a website that presents my favourite vinyl records details about them including the artwork and artist. It then has an option to purchase the record. It also has a list of the top most sold records.

## UX
This website is used to showcase my love for music to the world using different layouts and pictures. This website is aimed at fellow music lovers like myself and has a range of music for everyone no matter what your tastes are.

As a user, I would like to be able to explore different types of music, to find more information about the artist and there album's.
As a user, I would like to be able to listen to the music of my choice, to decide if I like it before I buy it.

## Deployment

I used a local host and once I was happy I commited to github to check that everything ran smoothly there aswell. 









Features
When I was building the website I wanted the user to feel like they could get more information about the artist easily,
so I built a clickable link witch links off to my second page witch has plenty of information about the given artist.

How
I spent a lot of time going around in circles not knowing what to do this project on then I heard a suggestion from a family member witch just clicked with me and made me driven to make a really nice and clean website for vinyl.
I used chrome dev tools a lot for inspecting elements on the page and figuring out bugs,
this included using coverage tab to look trough my CSS and html and to see if there where any elements I wasn't using,
I was shown how to use the network tab to see what was being loaded and what was taking a long time to load.

I also started using Chrome lighthouse witch is a tool that audits your website in 5 different category,
Performance, progressive web app, Best practices, accessibility, SEO.

I used bootstrap in this project witch had a lot of successes and of course problems,
when I was using bootstrap I found that there was a lot of hidden things that wasn't letting me do certain things and the only way I figured this out was because of chrome dev tools,
otherwise I would of been stuck for ever trying to figure out what the problem was.




I used standard bootstrap navbar but in the collapsed state I wanted it to be on the right hand side so I overwrote bootstrap and push it to the right

I started thinking to myself what else could I do then I came up with an idea that I could sell the records so I made a page that has a form that asks for the users information so that they can buy a record of there choosing.

Features to implement
So what I would like to do is to connect the website to a artist information API and then get live data from that so it can update and change according to the users interests,
would also like to have a sort section if this feature is implemented.


When I was testing I spent a lot of time trying to get it to look good on mobile so I spent a lot of time in google dev tools changing things around and testing different thing to see what would work.

One "bug" I incountered was that I was wondering why my website looked different on GitHub page then my local host then after a hour or two of moving things around trying to figured it out I then realise that the website was in fact zoomed out.
