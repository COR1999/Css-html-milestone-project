Vinyl O'Rourke

What
This is a website that is based on my favourite vinyl records and being able to purcase them,
also has a list of the top 8 most sold records Ever.



Why
On this website i wish to showcase my love for music to the world using differant layouts on my websites and pictures,
because pictures are alot easyier to take in.

Who
this website is aimed at fellow music lovers like myself and has a range of music for everyone no matter what your tastes are,

When
this project took me roughly 1 month over i started early december and finished it around mid january,

Where
You can find this page only on github pages but if there is every a time that it goes live you will be able to find it at WWW.Vinlylorourke.com

How
I spent alot of time going around in circles not knowing what to do this project on then i heard a sugestion from a family memmber witch just clicked with me and made me driven to make a really nice and clean website for vinyl.
i used chrome devtools alot for inspecting elements on the page and figuring out bugs,
this included using coverage tab to look trough my css and html and to see if there where any elements i wasnt using,
i was showen how to use the network tab to see what was being loaded and what was taking a long time to load.

I also started using Chrome lighthouse witch is a tool that audits your website in 5 differant catagorys,
Performance, progressive web app, Best practices, accessibility, SEO.

i used boostrap in this project witch had alot of sucesses and ofcourse problems,
when i was using boostrap i found that there was alot of hidden things that wasnt letting me do certain things and the only way i figured this out was because of chrome dev tools,
otherwise i would of been stuck for ever trying to figure out what the problem was.



Features
When i was building the website i wanted the user to feel like they could get more information about the arist easyly,
so i build a clickable link witch links off to my second page witch has plently of information about the given arist.

I used standard boostrap navbar but in the collapsed state i wanted it to be on the right hand side so i overwrote boostrap and push it to the right


I started thinking to myself what else could i do then i came up with an idea that i could sell the records so i made a page that has a form that asks for the users information so that they can buy a record of there choosing.


Features to implement
So what i would like to do is to connect the website to a artist information api and then get live data from that so it can update and change acording to the users intrests,
would also like to have a sort section if this feature is implemented.



When i was testing i spent alot of time trying to get it to look good on mobile so i spent alot of time in google dev tools changing things around and testing differant thing to see what would work.

One "bug" i incountered was that i was wondering why my webite looked different on github page then my local host then after a hour or two of moving things around trying to figured it out i then realise that the website was infact zoomed out.
